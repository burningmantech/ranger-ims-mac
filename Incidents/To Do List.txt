• Sort dispatch queue by soemthing useful at launch
  • See DispatchQueue.sortedIncidents.

• Fix out of bounds issue when selecting/deselecting "show closed"

• Autocomplete Ranger handles
  • Perhaps limit Ranger hnaldes to a list.
  • We may want to allow unknown handles, though, eg:
    • if the list is incomplete for some reason
    • if we need to enter a non-Ranger responder

• Autocomplete incident types
  • Also: limit incident types to a predefined list
